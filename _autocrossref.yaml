## [pattern to match in file][reference to give it]
#
## If you have a patten you usually want to match (such as "satoshi"
## (currency)) but which may appear a few times where you don't want it
## to match (such as "Satoshi" (name)), use the zero-space word-joiner
## character (&#8288;) in the middle of the term you don't want to
## match. E.g.:
### Bitcoin was invented by Sa&#8288;toshi Nakamoto.
## This is ugly, but it gets the job done.

## Terms sorted alphabetically (for the sake of human editors)
#
## Recommendation: use base ("") for singular; use references for
## plurals. E.g.: block: "", blocks: block
#
## Mandatory: terms that will be used by themselves inside `` need to
## have their `` form defined. E.g.: "script" => "", "`script`" =>
## "script"
#
## Terms inside longer `` spans won't work. You'll have to stop
## using autocrossref mode to get them to work correctly. E.g.:
## `you can't put script here` unless you prefix it with
## {% endautocrossref %}
